# GR5405 Series SoC



## 1. Introduction

- The Goodix GR5405 is an automotive Bluetooth LE 5.3 SoC designed to operate across a wide temperature range from –40°C to 105°C, and is AEC-Q100 Grade 2 certified. It is suitable for various automotive applications, including digital key and Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).
- Based on Arm® Cortex®-M4F CPU core running at 64 MHz, the GR5405 integrates a 2.4 GHz RF transceiver, Bluetooth LE 5.3 protocol stack, 512 KB on-chip Flash memory, 96 KB system SRAM, and a rich set of peripherals. It provides outstanding RF performance, with a maximum TX power of +15 dBm, an RX sensitivity of -99 dBm in Bluetooth LE 1 Mbps mode, achieving an overall link budget of up to 114 dB.
- The GR5405 supports connection between multiple centrals and multiple peripherals. It can be configured as a Broadcaster, an Observer, a Peripheral, or a Central, and supports the combination of all the above roles.
